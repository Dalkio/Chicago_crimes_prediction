# Chicago crimes prediction

Projet I worked on with my team during the Machine Learning class session at Ã‰cole Polytechnique. <br />
The goal was to utilize several datasets and machine learning techniques in order to forecast crime occurrences within the
City of Chicago, and bring new insights into the pattern of criminal activity across its districts. <br />
Besides, we redefined more appropriate location clusters in order to be more precise in our predictions.

## HOW TO USE:

* Download the datasets:  
  * Historical crimes dataset in Chicago: <br /> https://www.dropbox.com/s/urce7z000srsiav/Crimes_-_2008_to_present.csv
  * Docioeconomic dataset in Chicago per community area: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kodjiy0ctvvam71/chi_se_2008_2012.csv
* Place them into a data/ directory
* The notebook files can now be executed
